# Real-time-News-Analyst-agentic-MCP

## Purpose of the Project

The primary purpose of this project is to develop an autonomous, multi-agent system that can continuously monitor, analyze, and summarize live news data from multiple sources to provide timely and accurate insights for decision-makers.

In todayâ€™s information-driven environment, traditional news aggregation systems only collect and display headlines without offering meaningful context or analysis. This project aims to bridge that gap by leveraging Agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a network of intelligent agents capable of reasoning over real-time data.

## Objectives

1.	Develop a Real-Time News Retrieval Framework
2.	Design and Implement Multiple Specialized Agents
3.	Automate News Classification and Summarization
4.	Enable Contextual Querying through MCP
5.	Ensure Data Reliability and Explainability
6.	Deliver Actionable Intelligence and Alerts
